# Plan

## 1. Port the examples NSIS ships

`tests/ports.rs` checks each port in `tests/ports/` against its original by
`makensis -V4` trace: the effect lines have to match. Pages are left out,
because Installua only writes MUI2 pages. A line the original writes inside a
macro is invisible to `-V4`, so `HIDDEN` lists the port's copy.

Ported: `example1`, `example2`, `Memento`, `MultiUser`, `one-section`,
`primes`, `silent` and the five `Modern UI/` examples.

Next, from `$NSISDIR/Examples`: `bigtest`, `LogicLib`, `languages`, `Library`,
`StrFunc`, `unicode`, `VersionInfo`, the `FileFunc`/`TextFunc`/`WordFunc`
ones, and the `nsDialogs/`, `StartMenu/` and `System/` directories.

Not portable: `rtest` tests `GetLabelAddress` and `Call` through an address,
both rejected.

**Rule:** a port that needs a missing feature or hits a bug waits. The fix
goes into Installua first, with its own golden, and the port follows.

## 2. Review the `todo` sites

`src/lower` has 55 `self.todo(` calls (39 in `mod.rs`, 12 in `expr.rs`, 3 in
`handle.rs`, 1 in `library.rs`). Each is a shape the compiler does not
support. For each, decide whether ordinary code reaches it: if so, it is a
missing feature, and it gets a spelling or a real diagnostic; if not, it stays.

## Later: random programs

Generate random well-typed programs from the grammar, compile them, and run
`makensis -WX`. A panic, a generic `not-yet-implemented` or a `makensis` error
is a finding. Worth it only once the two above are done.
