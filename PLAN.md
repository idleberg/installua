# Plan

Work for the 0.2.x patch releases: missing spellings and the work around them.
Bugs go in `KNOWN-ISSUES.md`.

## 1. Port the examples NSIS ships

`tests/ports.rs` checks each port in `tests/ports/` against its original by
`makensis -V4` trace: the effect lines have to match. Pages are left out,
because Installua only writes MUI2 pages. A line the original writes inside a
macro is invisible to `-V4`, so `HIDDEN` lists the port's copy.

Ported: `example1`, `example2`, `Memento`, `MultiUser`, `one-section`,
`primes`, `silent` and the five `Modern UI/` examples.

Next, from `$NSISDIR/Examples`: `bigtest`, `LogicLib`, `languages`, `Library`,
`StrFunc`, `unicode`, `VersionInfo`, the `FileFunc`/`TextFunc`/`WordFunc`
ones, and the `nsDialogs/`, `StartMenu/` and `System/` directories.

Not portable: `rtest` tests `GetLabelAddress` and `Call` through an address,
both rejected.

**Rule:** a port that needs a missing feature or hits a bug waits. The fix
goes into Installua first, with its own golden, and the port follows.

## 2. Plain wording in the docs

Words that made sense while building Installua but mean nothing to someone
reading the site cold. Each hit is rewritten to say the thing itself, not
swapped for a synonym. Counts are for `web/src/content/docs/`.

| Word | Hits | Say instead |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| shape | ~25 | what it actually is: "form", "signature", "number of values", "kind of mistake" |
| half, halves | ~25 | "installer and uninstaller", "the case-sensitive version", "the MUI2 part" |
| spelling, spell | 60 | "name", "syntax", "way to write"; "the format has no spelling for it" → "a `.toml` can't describe it" |
| lowering, lowers | 30 | "compiles to", "is turned into" |
| corpus | 28 | say once per page what it is (the scripts surveyed), then "those scripts" |
| the rule, half of the rule | 9 | name the rule in place: "no public script calls it" |
| surface, census, load-bearing, honest, wearing, genuinely, quietly | ~35 | case by case, usually delete the word |

Keep: the tagline and page titles "Lua-shaped, not Lua" / "NSIS-shaped, not
NSIS" (they are URLs and the project's pitch), and literal uses ("two and a half
times", "half-converted", "which half of the registry"), and the generated
`cli.md`.

Order, most hits first: `reference/commands/plugins-and-headers.md`,
`reference/plugins/third-party-plugins.md`, `reference/plugins/what-stays-out.md`,
`reference/commands/not-available.md`, `reference/modern-ui.md`, then the rest.
One file per pass, re-read after, `mise run check` at the end (`tests/docs.rs`
matches names, so removing a name by accident fails it).

Not a word problem, left for later: "rather than" (85 hits) is a tic, not
jargon.

## Later: random programs

Generate random well-typed programs from the grammar, compile them, and run
`makensis -WX`. A panic, a generic `not-yet-implemented` or a `makensis` error
is a finding. Worth it only once the items above are done.
